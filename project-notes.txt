TODO for Feb 12th 
- we need to add dynamic behavior to our website
- we want the smallest increment of functionality
- lambda function
    input - list of ingredients
    output - a recipe that is in the system and uses only the specified ingredients

    lambda can output one recipe always that is not in the database
